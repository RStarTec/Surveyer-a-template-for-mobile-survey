## Surveyer

----
### Purpose

This is a template app to demonstrate how to create surveys that target at certain underprivileged groups, which tend to have minimal assess to technology and may have limited education background. Surveys catered for such groups are designed to have minimum reading requirements, and to be highly pictorial and audio-enabled. Survey responses are intentionally simple (such as yes/no). Survey questionnaires are divided into small sections composing of 4-6 questions each, so that each section is well within an ordinary user's attention span. Small rewards can be provided upon the completion of each section to incentivize the completion of the full survey. 

In this current version of the app, a basic design is provided to illustrate the above ideas. In building of this app, special attention has been paid to address the circumstances of the target user groups. These considerations have consolidated into the following features:
* Affordability: The choice app platform has to be one that is most affordable and accessible to the greatest diversity of users. For this consideration, the Android platform has been chosen.
* Data cost: Data upload and download can be a hidden cost for users who are unaware of the limitations of their data plans. To minimize any cost this survey could impose on the user, the app is designed to optimize on its capacity and data exchange. Pictures, audios and data are streamlined to provide high resolution without redundancy.
* Ease of use: The design of the app takes on the minimalist's approach in terms of its operations, so that the user may master its functionality within a short period of time.

For security reason, the following components are not included in this template:
* Security and identification measures: the app may be tailored to request for a secure passcode from the user. The language used (both in text and in audio) may be customized based on the user's native language. The responses collected by the app can be encrypted with this user's passcode.
* Server connection: To be fully functional, the app needs to have connection to a host server which collects the survey data and dispenses the rewards.
